# EI-Connect
IoT/EI-PaaS Connection libraries for IoT/EI-PaaS client.

## DESCRIPTION
----

**EI-Connect** â€“ the connection libraries to communicate between device and IoT/EI-PaaS Server.
Advantech provides a software development libraries to communicate and exchange information between target device and IoT/EI-PaaS Server, called EI-Connect.
The EI-Connect provides a rich set of user-friendly, intelligent and integrated interfaces, which speeds development, enhances security and makes agent application easier and simpler to communicate with IoT/EI-PaaS Server.
The framework has several benefits:

* Standardization - The communication protocol is based on the MQTT protocol to communicate and exchange data with IoT/EI-PaaS Server. The IoT sensor data report format is following the IPSO Spec. in JSON format.
* Portability - Whole framework is written in C language and follow the ANSI C Standard, that C compilers are available for most systems and are often the first compiler provided for a new system.


## OVERVIEW
----

 The EI-Connect includes:
 
 Library:
  * libWISECore.so
  	- Core library of EI-Connect to handshake with IoT/EI-PaaS Server.
 
  * libWISEConnector.so
  	- Manage the MQTT connection.
	 
Application:     
  * Sample\WISECoreSample:
  	- Lightweight agent sample application for both Windows and Linux.

  * Sample\MosquittoSample:
  	- Sample application, implement based on EI-PaaS handshake protocol with MQTT library,for both Windows and Linux.
